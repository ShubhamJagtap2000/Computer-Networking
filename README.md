# Computer Networking

## **Computer Networking is very important aspect in securing the networks, systems and directly or indirectly, securing the organization. Hence, the knowledge of networking is must for every cybersecurity enthusiast.**

## It comprises of Computer Networking and Ethical Hacking Training I've taken from various platforms. 

## Introduction:

## Why we must learn Computer Networking?
- To hack a device, one should know how computer devices interact with each other.
- Two or more devices are connected with each other to form a computer network.
- Devices are connected to each other for purpose of file sharing, resource sharing, communication, etc.
- Devices in a computer network(communicating or network devices) are called **'nodes'**.
